# Using the Sketch design file

Using this design files will help you practice building projects in the same way professionals do. Seeing the details in the design will help you improve your accuracy when building projects and build projects faster.

[Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is a popular design tool, but it requires a license and macOS in order to use it. If you've got both, the Sketch file will be a great option for you.

If you haven't used Sketch before, here's a great guide that gives [Sketch tips for developers](https://blog.prototypr.io/sketch-tips-for-developers-4cbc9789b244).

You can also import the Sketch file into Adobe XD, if you prefer to use that. We provide information on how to do this below.

## Adobe XD

We don't include XD files as a download option, but if you want to use it you can import the Sketch file into Adobe XD very easily. 

It's worth noting that there can be rendering issues when importing Sketch files into XD, so we strongly recommend using either Sketch or Figma to view the designs.

If you do want to get started with XD though, [head over to the downloads page and choose the free version](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/xd/pricing/individual.html). Once you’ve downloaded and opened the app, go to File > Open from Your Computer and then find the challenge Sketch file on your computer and open it up. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to dive into the design on Adobe XD!

**⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️: Please be sure not to share our design files with anyone else. We include `.gitignore` files in the starter code download to help prevent you from accidentally uploading it to GitHub. Another easy way to prevent this is to keep the design file separate from your codebase.**
